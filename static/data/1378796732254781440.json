Tried a bunch of things, still no dice--just no artifact definition is loaded into infrahub from my repo (but no error message or other indication of a problem).  My rendered j2 templates worked fine in `infrahubctl`, and I could see them and the .gql in infrahub.\n\nThen, I finally thought to check the artifact definition in the demo edge repo [here](https://github.com/opsmill/infrahub-demo-edge/blob/main/.infrahub.yml), and I see that between `name:` and `artifact_name:` , they are reversed regarding which one is plain text vs. the one that's a slug/human friendly id (no spaces). In other words:\n```\nartifact_definitions:\n  - name: \"device_configuration\"\n    artifact_name: \"Device configuration file\"\n```\nvs. \n```\nartifact_definitions:\n  - name: \"Openconfig Interface for Arista devices\"\n    artifact_name: \"openconfig-interfaces\"\n```\nWas so relieved to discover that the latter works! 🦦 \n\nWould love to contribute to the docs if this is a thing.  Is there a set procedure other than fork->edit-> submit PR?  (I have not yet looked into Docusaurus, but it looks fairly straightforward from the README).  I have also found some other things related to nautobot v2 config for infrahub-sync (re: my [Brownfield config importing](https://discord.com/channels/1212332642801025064/1371204788699533353) thread a couple of weeks ago) and maybe a couple of other things I could update (will have to go back and look through my terminal history).","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1378866668574474351","filename":"Screenshot_2025-06-01_at_3.42.23_PM.png","size":26107,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1378796732254781440/1378866668574474351/Screenshot_2025-06-01_at_3.42.23_PM.png?ex=693408e7&is=6932b767&hm=38ad754316e0b7326dec5588bd3832c590464b3caa55db86f8a6ae53a44b1952&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1378796732254781440/1378866668574474351/Screenshot_2025-06-01_at_3.42.23_PM.png?ex=693408e7&is=6932b767&hm=38ad754316e0b7326dec5588bd3832c590464b3caa55db86f8a6ae53a44b1952&","width":630,"height":174,"content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":2,"placeholder":"OxgCCoLD+3lkeOlHaHeAdgc=","placeholder_version":1,"title":"Screenshot 2025-06-01 at 3.42.23 PM"}],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-06-01T18:05:57.774000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-06-01T22:43:51.873000+00:00","flags":4,"components":[],"id":"1378796732254781440","channel_id":"1378796732254781440","author":{"id":"582311094438199328","username":"bellastr","avatar":"f12d5817933fd159ad8026ffc22ceadc","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"BellaStr","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false}]}]
