With computed attributes, especially on the entry names - which are always going to be \"MATCH/FROM\" or \"ACTION\" \n\nI could create a cascading computed attribute where the policy has a computed attribute that includes the device name, and the entry includes the computed attribute that includes the policy name, in it's name, etc. And that is a solution, but I'm curious if there's a way to just allow nodes to be assigned in their tree? Otherwise, I'll end up very quickly with a very large list of entries, all similar, when I'm only concerned with the entries that are only in the node sub graph I'm currently in. I'm not looking for traversing the tree, these are intended to be components/parent relationships, and if the parent goes away, all components (and sub-components) are deleted, etc. \n\nWIth building a catalog on top of this, none of this is an issue, but it does make for a messy GUI. \n\nThe second part of my question, is there an easier way to make a hierarchal / parent + component model? I'm creating two links in the graph, when one would do just find. The hierarchy is important as the viewing is faster, easier, and it lets me see more. The parent/component is necessary due to the reasons stated above (on delete cascade, etc). I don't want orphaned nodes hanging around with these.","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1339445174778069094","filename":"image.png","size":353586,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1339445174241071196/1339445174778069094/image.png?ex=6933a987&is=69325807&hm=afa912ffd672f68318b806aeabe36db161ff0ec26cdbe0b4920176df8f8dd8cd&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1339445174241071196/1339445174778069094/image.png?ex=6933a987&is=69325807&hm=afa912ffd672f68318b806aeabe36db161ff0ec26cdbe0b4920176df8f8dd8cd&","width":3504,"height":1146,"content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":2,"placeholder":"wfcBAoD6iNB1bb+CC4XjQDo=","placeholder_version":1},{"id":"1339445175188979762","filename":"image.png","size":159139,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1339445174241071196/1339445175188979762/image.png?ex=6933a987&is=69325807&hm=d5b11e440dad384381090291a2981f64b3d6701a1d7bfbbedefef2330b6e4acf&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1339445174241071196/1339445175188979762/image.png?ex=6933a987&is=69325807&hm=d5b11e440dad384381090291a2981f64b3d6701a1d7bfbbedefef2330b6e4acf&","width":800,"height":1196,"content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":2,"placeholder":"w/cFBQCPl5qH2ViXeWVIV6dnYIoG","placeholder_version":1}],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-02-13T03:56:55.227000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1339445174241071196","channel_id":"1339445174241071196","author":{"id":"1268206427810435166","username":"scotho3","avatar":"90c6511092222bc6f42f2614fb0ebef7","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"scotho3","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"}},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false}]}]
