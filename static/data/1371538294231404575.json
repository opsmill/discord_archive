All I see are examples of creating or upserting an object by its name (or I've missed that in the documentation). is the best way to do this via sync?  If so is there a generic sync?\n3. is there a method to flatten out the data you get back from a query. Say I get a list of objects and I want to flatten out to key/value pairs.
