This supports Diff, Merge, and Rebase operations.\n- Agnostic: All changes will automatically be available in all branches. This does not support Diff, Merge, or Rebase operations.\n- Local: All changes will stay local to the branch and will not be merged to other branches. This does not support Diff or Merge operations, but does support Rebase.\n\n## Configuration Examples\n\nTo configure a model as branch-agnostic:\n```\nnodes:\n  - name: Fruit\n    namespace: Example\n    branch: \"agnostic\"\n    attributes:\n      - kind: Text\n        name: name\n```\n\n## Individual Attribute/Relationship Configuration\n\nAttributes and relationships can be configured independently of their parent model using the branch parameter:\n```\nnodes:\n  - name: Fruit\n    namespace: Example\n    branch: \"agnostic\"\n    attributes:\n      - kind: Text\n        name: name\n        branch: \"aware\"\n```\n\n## Default Behavior\nBy default, if no specific value is defined:\n\n- Attributes inherit the configuration of their parent model\n- Relationships become branch-agnostic only if both models are branch-agnostic, otherwise they become branch-aware\n\nBranch-Agnostic Usage\nIn the frontend, API, or GraphQL endpoint, branch-agnostic objects can be modified on any branch with no restrictions.","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-09-08T08:15:49.325000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-09-08T08:15:55.454000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1414524617149775873","channel_id":"1414521420863766598","author":{"id":"1133022375051542558","username":"shabear_dis","avatar":"e5046d674427373d76e2dde9dc74feb5","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Benito","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false},{"type":0,"content":"Hi all, is there any documentation that will explain what do all those option for with example provided or explanation? currently i am reading infrahub documentation, and I find that, i can totally understand inside schema > node > there support branch, and the branch accepted values are: aware (default), agnostic, local. however I do not know how is this impact or change when i put in different value such as local.","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1414521421165629471","filename":"image.png","size":38257,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1414521420863766598/1414521421165629471/image.png?ex=6933e33b&is=693291bb&hm=a5766873fef963af549035e4df211bb978e09dc9f99280d03bb1fa62e8e29482&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1414521420863766598/1414521421165629471/image.png?ex=6933e33b&is=693291bb&hm=a5766873fef963af549035e4df211bb978e09dc9f99280d03bb1fa62e8e29482&","width":992,"height":353,"content_type":"image/png","original_content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":2,"placeholder":"+/cBAoBAVndsVXiZQ58g0wo=","placeholder_version":1},{"id":"1414521421916540998","filename":"image.png","size":34675,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1414521420863766598/1414521421916540998/image.png?ex=6933e33b&is=693291bb&hm=83929bd36a5c9e52c93e1c8b0367039c492699ab0b0ae66bacf8a8a323c39d15&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1414521420863766598/1414521421916540998/image.png?ex=6933e33b&is=693291bb&hm=83929bd36a5c9e52c93e1c8b0367039c492699ab0b0ae66bacf8a8a323c39d15&","width":481,"height":485,"content_type":"image/png","original_content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":2,"placeholder":"+/cBBwBQhLmMdmZneJlnWHd4DbQYQIsB","placeholder_version":1}],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-09-08T08:03:07.271000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-09-08T08:03:54.708000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1414521420863766598","channel_id":"1414521420863766598","author":{"id":"1410538819375202415","username":"fiery_monkey_64350","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"hl","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false}]}
