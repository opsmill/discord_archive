I wanted to share some quick feedback and report a potential issue.\n\nThe Good: I just finished the Schema interactive tutorial—it was excellent. It really helped clarify concepts that felt a bit abstract when reading the documentation alone.\n\nThe Issue: I moved on to the Artifacts Lab (https://play.instruqt.com/opsmill/landing-pages/xjwqgeqwohxt/tracks/infrahub-artifact-introduction), but it seems broken. The environment boots up, but no data/devices are loading. The device list remains empty.\n\nHas anyone else experienced this, or is it a known issue with the lab environment?\n\nWhy it matters: These interactive labs are a massive help for newcomers trying to get over the initial \"intimidation factor\" of the tool. It would be great to see this fixed to help future students/users get up to speed faster.\n\nThanks!","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-11-23T15:24:04.618000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1442173868805587104","channel_id":"1442173868805587104","author":{"id":"889249670101082123","username":"ghustla","avatar":"07411e35a6601708b52844267029a60c","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"GoniMcColly","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"👋"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}]}]}]
