That being said, I do think we will focus on single object templates with it's relations.\n\nWhat you are describing as a site template, sounds more like a use-case for generators. \n\nA site is typically build from a design and there's some business logic that you need to be able to apply to it, based on some input variables to be able to create an instance of that design. That is exactly what generators will solve.\nSo it's more of a combination of a template with some business logic. Hopefully that makes sense?\nPS: this idea is exactly the topic of our presentation at NANOG in 2 weeks","mentions":[{"id":"1033714246774706206","username":"sdktr","avatar":"9ee9b95b734aa5beefcd1f92c99b08b0","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Stefan de Kooter","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-01-24T09:16:34.675000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1332277861364797491","channel_id":"1332071289656967391","author":{"id":"1221732604806692884","username":"w_vandeun","avatar":"e9ac2093c5e49a4a05a41b375db9ac69","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Wim","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"}},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"position":6},{"type":19,"content":"My assumption from reading the line below in the feature request is that we can assign multiple templates to a given type of node\n\n\"When creating an object, if a template is tied to the schema node, provide it as a drop down option to select.\"","mentions":[{"id":"1033714246774706206","username":"sdktr","avatar":"9ee9b95b734aa5beefcd1f92c99b08b0","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Stefan de Kooter","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-01-23T22:16:04.193000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1332111639075618897","channel_id":"1332071289656967391","author":{"id":"123965055434883073","username":"themar4321","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Themar","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"message_reference":{"type":0,"channel_id":"1332071289656967391","message_id":"1332097912905142363","guild_id":"1212332642801025064"},"position":5,"referenced_message":{"type":0,"content":"I understand that ‘some form of’ hierarchy is within scope?
