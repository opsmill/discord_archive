Now when I make one small change to one attribute on one node, I have to review a diff that includes changes to both `human_friendly_id` and `display_label` which are auto-generated fields that I don't care about, not only on the node that I changed but also on related nodes.\n\nYou don't fully see if from the attached diff screenshot but for a change to one attribute (AS number) I now have 16 other nodes changed that pop up in the diff. Wouldn't it make sense to filter out `human_friendly_id` and `display_label` from the diff?","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1438073555224104971","filename":"Screenshot_2025-11-12_at_08.45.52.png","size":282472,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1437864644038627428/1438073555224104971/Screenshot_2025-11-12_at_08.45.52.png?ex=6933e05d&is=69328edd&hm=304043d6825b27183ec33bd0d8f2b3167282de27d4b627899d2c9da1930607cd&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1437864644038627428/1438073555224104971/Screenshot_2025-11-12_at_08.45.52.png?ex=6933e05d&is=69328edd&hm=304043d6825b27183ec33bd0d8f2b3167282de27d4b627899d2c9da1930607cd&","width":2274,"height":1386,"content_type":"image/png","original_content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":2,"placeholder":"/PcBDIBuw7BheIiMaHk/aPmElg==","placeholder_version":1,"title":"Screenshot 2025-11-12 at 08.45.52"}],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-11-12T07:50:53.738000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1438073555467112622","channel_id":"1437864644038627428","author":{"id":"918504524610695168","username":"dpeach44","avatar":"91d80b360d48938482b8a7e23147d057","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"dpeach","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"position":1},{"type":0,"content":"Yes, this is expected","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-11-11T20:32:36.955000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1437902860787515585","channel_id":"1437864644038627428","author":{"id":"1221732604806692884","username":"w_vandeun","avatar":"e9ac2093c5e49a4a05a41b375db9ac69","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Wim","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"}},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false},{"type":0,"content":"After the v1.5 upgrade the HFID changes now show in the PC diff.
