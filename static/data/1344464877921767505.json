it?","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-03-02T22:55:29.388000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1345892298315141172","channel_id":"1344464877921767505","author":{"id":"683947864099258368","username":"svk3639","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"SVK","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"}},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"position":25},{"type":0,"content":"The
