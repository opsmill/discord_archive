I thought it might be a dependency issue, so I started removing everything step by step to test. I removed Artifact Definition, Transformation, Artifact, and even all devices. For some reason, I couldn’t remove the Transformation file, and the error still remained.\n\nThen I ran sudo docker compose -p infrahub down -v\nto reset everything and restarted the setup. The first thing I did was add my Git repository again, but I got the same Import Error. I assumed it was because my main branch was empty, so I created a new branch called branch35 without syncing with Git. I loaded my menu, schema, and simulated data into this new branch, but the error still persisted.\n\nLater, I realized my main branch had already imported the Queries and Transformations files even though there was a sync error, while branch35 did not have them (see screenshot).\n\nWith that clue, I loaded the same menu, schema, and simulated data into the main branch, and the sync issue was finally resolved.\n\nWhat confuses me is that I thought the files (.infrahub.yml, .gpl, .py) in the Git repository integrated with Infrahub were shared across all branches, since the list in the Tasks tab under the Git repository looks the same even when I switch between branches.\n\nSo moving forward, if I want to test a new transformation, I think I should create a new branch with Git Sync enabled and edit the .infrahub.yml files in that branch instead. Please correct me if I’m wrong.","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1430049559203287041","filename":"Screenshot_2025-10-21_at_12.01.31_PM.png","size":448001,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1430049558632599683/1430049559203287041/Screenshot_2025-10-21_at_12.01.31_PM.png?ex=6933b06f&is=69325eef&hm=53b44786ce31377d56e3efbd1d183e9275b7a906640d92608daa10d1f7d22920&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1430049558632599683/1430049559203287041/Screenshot_2025-10-21_at_12.01.31_PM.png?ex=6933b06f&is=69325eef&hm=53b44786ce31377d56e3efbd1d183e9275b7a906640d92608daa10d1f7d22920&","width":1846,"height":1186,"content_type":"image/png","original_content_type":"image/png","content_scan_version":2,"placeholder":"+/cFBIAxRFRziId9iHDmcKWb+A==","placeholder_version":1,"title":"Screenshot 2025-10-21 at 12.01.31 PM"}],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-10-21T04:26:23.814000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1430049558632599683","channel_id":"1430049558632599683","author":{"id":"846244078575943680","username":"jinh0e","avatar":"64dabc243532002393161796f39770a0","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Jin","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false}]}
