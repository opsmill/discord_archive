So either here, or send me a DM, can you let us know what you're trying to accomplish? Not only in Infrahub, but the overall automation flow? This would be invaluable for us to design the right solution for the community!","mentions":[{"id":"402535819904155659","username":"dhoutz","avatar":"42d146479ee847fb003481fd78a7311f","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Dan Houtz","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-11-12T07:17:49.196000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1438065231694921801","channel_id":"1436803657059401789","author":{"id":"1212726983944052798","username":"pete_crocker","avatar":"2ce15ce78115631a666e77b58952f91e","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Pete Crocker","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"}},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"position":5},{"type":0,"content":"Try to keep the groups containing one kind. \n\nhttps://docs.infrahub.app/guides/jinja2-transform","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://docs.infrahub.app/guides/jinja2-transform","title":"Creating a Jinja transform | Infrahub Documentation","description":"Within Infrahub a Transform is defined in an external repository.
