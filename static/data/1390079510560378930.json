The common_parent property only works for validation, not for filtering the selection.\n\nExpected behavior:\nI would expect the dropdowns for profile_one and profile_two to be filtered to only show profiles associated with the same device as the Application.\n\nBug:\nAdditionally, there is a bug where the object does not get created at all. Please see the attached video for details.\n\nRequest:\nCan you make common_parent also affect the UI filtering dynamically in a single form, so users only see relevant profiles in the dropdowns when creating or editing an Application?\n\nPlease let me know if this is a valid and intended usecase for common_parent worth creating a feature request for.\n\nThanks!","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[{"id":"1390079511856676957","filename":"Screen_Recording_2025-07-02_at_23.10.40.mov","size":15753935,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1390079510560378930/1390079511856676957/Screen_Recording_2025-07-02_at_23.10.40.mov?ex=6933f52e&is=6932a3ae&hm=0c76bd6f146d616f6a5f38a8e29777db2b5a0757f61fc04d7f187d6d2f3f20ff&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1390079510560378930/1390079511856676957/Screen_Recording_2025-07-02_at_23.10.40.mov?ex=6933f52e&is=6932a3ae&hm=0c76bd6f146d616f6a5f38a8e29777db2b5a0757f61fc04d7f187d6d2f3f20ff&","width":2880,"height":1328,"content_type":"video/quicktime","content_scan_version":2,"placeholder":"/fcBA4BGPDZvo2V3P8HuMM0=","placeholder_version":1,"title":"Screen Recording 2025-07-02 at 23.10.40"},{"id":"1390079512930422845","filename":"common_parent.yml","size":2066,"url":"https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1390079510560378930/1390079512930422845/common_parent.yml?ex=6933f52e&is=6932a3ae&hm=357a9bbfe7c9d7f7c4463b16d2fb80deafc496b8a3001cc454e2fee7b27f4c32&","proxy_url":"https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1390079510560378930/1390079512930422845/common_parent.yml?ex=6933f52e&is=6932a3ae&hm=357a9bbfe7c9d7f7c4463b16d2fb80deafc496b8a3001cc454e2fee7b27f4c32&","content_type":"text/plain; charset=utf-8","content_scan_version":2}],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-07-02T21:19:41.746000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1390079510560378930","channel_id":"1390079510560378930","author":{"id":"811281824768458793","username":"matej3653","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Matej Lanca","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"}},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false}]}]
