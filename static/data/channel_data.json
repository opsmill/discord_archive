This is a space to ask questions, share solutions, and support each other with anything related to Infrahub. To keep the channel productive and helpful, please follow these guidelines:\n\n1. Check Existing Topics First\n\n\t•\tBefore posting, use the search bar to see if your question has already been asked and answered.\n\t•\tAvoid duplicate questions to keep the forum tidy and focused.\n\n2. Use Descriptive Titles\n\n\t•\tTitle your question clearly and specifically (e.g., “Issue with InfraHub deployment on AWS” instead of “Help needed”).\n\t•\tThis helps others understand the topic quickly and makes it easier to search for similar issues later.\n\n3. Provide Details & Context\n\n\t•\tInclude necessary details like InfraHub version, environment setup, specific error messages, and any troubleshooting steps you’ve already tried.\n\t•\tThe more context you provide, the easier it will be for others to help you accurately.\n\n4. Stay on Topic\n\n\t•\tKeep conversations within each topic focused on the original question. If a new issue arises, create a new topic.\n\t•\tThis keeps the forum organized and relevant.\n\n5. Be Patient and Respectful\n\n\t•\tRemember that everyone here is volunteering their time to help. Give people time to respond and always interact respectfully.\n\t•\tConstructive feedback is welcome; personal attacks or rude behavior are not tolerated.\n\n6. Follow-Up and Close Out Your Question\n\n\t•\tIf your question has been answered, mark it as resolved or leave a final comment to let others know the solution worked.\n\t•\tThis helps others who may have similar questions in the future.\n\n7. No Self-Promotion or Spam\n\n\t•\tAvoid promoting unrelated products, services, or Discord servers. This channel is strictly for InfraHub-related questions and discussions.\n\n8. Use Code Blocks for Technical Information\n\n\t•\tIf you’re sharing logs, code snippets, or commands, use code blocks (wrap text in triple backticks like this) for better readability.\n\n9. Ask for Clarification When Needed\n\n\t•\tIf someone’s response isn’t clear, politely ask for clarification. We’re here to help everyone understand InfraHub better.\n\n10. Give Back to the Community\n\n\t•\tIf you find solutions or learn something useful, consider sharing it here. Your insights may help others with similar challenges.\n\nThank you for keeping our community helpful and supportive.","position":0,"permission_overwrites":[{"id":"1212332642801025064","type":0,"allow":"0","deny":"0"}],"nsfw":false,"available_tags":[{"id":"1301914864339648552","name":"Schema","moderated":false,"emoji_id":null,"emoji_name":"🧩"},{"id":"1301914968001744937","name":"Generator","moderated":false,"emoji_id":null,"emoji_name":"🏭"},{"id":"1301915115469410304","name":"Artifact","moderated":false,"emoji_id":null,"emoji_name":"📜"},{"id":"1301915235380363266","name":"Setup & Installation","moderated":false,"emoji_id":null,"emoji_name":"⚙️"},{"id":"1301915552855494666","name":"Otter posting","moderated":false,"emoji_id":null,"emoji_name":"🦦"},{"id":"1301915943663960064","name":"Help!","moderated":false,"emoji_id":null,"emoji_name":"🆘"},{"id":"1301916056205656276","name":"Misc","moderated":false,"emoji_id":"1244959371415392267","emoji_name":null},{"id":"1304062537364410420","name":"SDK","moderated":false,"emoji_id":null,"emoji_name":"📦"},{"id":"1304062588858007572","name":"Idea","moderated":false,"emoji_id":null,"emoji_name":"💡"},{"id":"1304062716125773886","name":"Bug","moderated":false,"emoji_id":null,"emoji_name":"🐛"},{"id":"1305808046747816046","name":"Integration","moderated":false,"emoji_id":null,"emoji_name":"🏗️"},{"id":"1305932861442097223","name":"Git repository","moderated":false,"emoji_id":null,"emoji_name":"🗄️"},{"id":"1322475882421555200","name":"Solved","moderated":true,"emoji_id":null,"emoji_name":"✅"}],"default_reaction_emoji":null,"default_sort_order":null,"default_forum_layout":1,"default_tag_setting":"match_some","icon_emoji":null,"theme_color":null,"template":""}]
