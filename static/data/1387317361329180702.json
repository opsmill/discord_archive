I'm thinking things like  adding devices, IP addresses, circuits, etc? I know we have emma for schema development and I have enjoyed testing that out.\n\nOne example I'm thinking about are users asking the AI agent to build a new /24 subnet using Vlan 200 at Site A and use the next available subnet from ip pool \"Site Pools\". The Agent then discovers what devices are at Site A and how they are all connected. It adds Vlan 200 to all the trunk ports and puts the gateway IP(s) on the Core switches or Firewall. It puts all these changes into a branch for the engineer to review/approve.\n\nAnother example I can see is the engineer asks the AI Agent to build a new EVPN instance from Site A to Site Z with a single 10G port on each side for a point to point connection. The AI agent then evaluates the current devices at Site A and Site Z finding devices with available ports that can support the request. It then builds out the appropriate EVPN configurations to create the point to point circuit from Device A port A to Device Z port Z and loads all these changes into a new branch for review/approval.","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-06-25T06:23:54.051000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1387317361329180702","channel_id":"1387317361329180702","author":{"id":"123965055434883073","username":"themar4321","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Themar","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false}]}]
