I was wondering if it's possible to install Infrahub in an offline environment (e.g. a network that isn't connected to the Internet).\n\nThe main ways to get Infrahub up and running, from what I've seen, are basically Docker compose, and Kubernetes.\n\nThe Docker compose \"route\" requires the server to call out and fetch images / install info from the Internet. Our environment doesn't allow that unfortunately.\n\nEven a method maybe where you have an online Ubuntu server connected to the Internet, and have that run the docker compose stuff, and then somehow save a snapshot of that image and transfer it to the offline system and get it up and running on there.\n\nCan anybody think of a way to get this to work? I'd really like to test out Infrahub, but can't seem to get around this.","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-04-01T14:26:51.656000+00:00","edited_timestamp":"2025-04-01T14:41:34.456000+00:00","flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1356635933637873885","channel_id":"1356635933637873885","author":{"id":"1352654639522123826","username":"thomas_72011","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Thomas","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false}]}]
