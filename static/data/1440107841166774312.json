at this a little more with overloadbit\n- in the prefect UI, we can see that a `branch-rebase` flow is running for the first branch to be rebased during the upgrade. we can see that diff update task is active as a sub-task of the `branch-rebase` flow: it has a name like `Update diff for main - branch1: (timestamp1-timestamp2),tracking_id=branch.branch1)`\n- this is the task name for the `DiffCoordinator._update_diffs` method and this could only be called if all of the necessary locks were successfully acquired, but then there are no logs within this task and there should be quite a few as it runs\n- the lack of logs makes me think that maybe something is going wrong with running this tasks in prefect\nare other tasks running and logging successfully?","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-11-19T19:01:43.373000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1440779089731518526","channel_id":"1440107841166774312","author":{"id":"1219339234947760279","username":"nermut_bundaloy","avatar":"727b45a591264174342d3251901069eb","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"nermut","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"position":7},{"type":0,"content":"I'll
