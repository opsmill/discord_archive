The tab that is shown will show all objects that inherit from that generic, but we will only list the attributes and relationships of kind attribute and parent defined on that generic.\n\nThe way to work around that today, is to remove the relationship to the generic and instead create relationships to each individual interface type. Then you could have multiple tabs on the device view for each interface type and you play with the attributes and relationship kinds to determine what you want to see in the table.\n\nThe downside is that theres more relations to manage and that there is no single view which would list you all the interfaces.","mentions":[{"id":"1352654639522123826","username":"thomas_72011","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Thomas","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-05-14T21:10:29.667000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1372320189558951978","channel_id":"1372276900721983498","author":{"id":"1221732604806692884","username":"w_vandeun","avatar":"e9ac2093c5e49a4a05a41b375db9ac69","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Wim","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"}},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"position":2,"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"👍"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}]},{"type":0,"content":"<@1352654639522123826> \nby default, most attributes Kind and the relationships of Kind `Attribute` and `Parent` will be displayed in a Table \nyou can find the details in the docs\n- https://docs.infrahub.app/topics/schema#attribute-kinds\n- https://docs.infrahub.app/topics/schema#relationship-kinds","mentions":[{"id":"1352654639522123826","username":"thomas_72011","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Thomas","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null}],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[{"type":"article","url":"https://docs.infrahub.app/topics/schema","title":"Schema | Infrahub Documentation","description":"In Infrahub, the schema is at the center of most things and our goal is to provide as much flexibility as possible to allow users to extend and customize the schema.","content_scan_version":0}],"timestamp":"2025-05-14T20:33:05.751000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1372310777893093457","channel_id":"1372276900721983498","author":{"id":"695690467056025690","username":"dgarros","avatar":"67171294847dca2ce3ac938f5bca0443","discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Damien","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"},"primary_guild":{"identity_guild_id":"1212332642801025064","identity_enabled":true,"tag":"OTTO","badge":"40122d86938d2a7824dfd9bd695abe81"}},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false,"position":1,"reactions":[{"emoji":{"id":null,"name":"👍"},"count":1,"count_details":{"burst":0,"normal":1},"burst_colors":[],"me_burst":false,"burst_me":false,"me":false,"burst_count":0}]},{"type":0,"content":"I guess what I'm wondering is what determines which attributes / properties show up in a table?","mentions":[],"mention_roles":[],"attachments":[],"embeds":[],"timestamp":"2025-05-14T19:55:53.378000+00:00","edited_timestamp":null,"flags":0,"components":[],"id":"1372301414641959163","channel_id":"1372276900721983498","author":{"id":"1352654639522123826","username":"thomas_72011","avatar":null,"discriminator":"0","public_flags":0,"flags":0,"banner":null,"accent_color":null,"global_name":"Thomas","avatar_decoration_data":null,"collectibles":null,"display_name_styles":null,"banner_color":null,"clan":null,"primary_guild":null},"pinned":false,"mention_everyone":false,"tts":false},{"type":0,"content":"What controls which columns are visible in a table?
